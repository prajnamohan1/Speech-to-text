# Speech-to-text
It's a very powerful browser interface that allows you to record human speech and convert it into text.
The Web Speech API is actually separated into two totally independent interfaces. 
We have SpeechRecognition for understanding human voice and turning it into text (Speech -> Text) and SpeechSynthesis for reading strings
out loud in a computer generated voice (Text -> Speech). 
The Speech Recognition API is surprisingly accurate for a free browser feature. It recognized correctly almost all 
of my speaking and knew which words go together to form phrases that make sense.
It also allows you to dictate special characters like full stops, question marks, and new lines.
